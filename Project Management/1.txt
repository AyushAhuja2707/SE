The main aim of PROJECT SCHEDULING AND
TRACKING is to get the project completed on time. Program evaluation and review technique
(PERT) and Gantt chart are two project scheduling methods that can be applied to software
development
Split the project into tasks and estimate time and resources required to complete each task.
Organize tasks concurrently to make optimal 
use of workforce. Minimize task dependencies to avoid delays 
caused by one task waiting for another to complete
Gantt chart:
A Gantt chart, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful
ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against time. On the left of the chart is a

bar; the position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration and end date of the activity.
This allows you to see at a glance:
 What the various activities are
 When each activity begins and ends
 How long each activity is scheduled to last
 Where activities overlap with other activities, and by how much
 The start and end date of the whole projec
